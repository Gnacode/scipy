Scientific Python for Minicubes

A group of entusiast from GNACODE wish to bring faster features to people using the minicubes. Since the minicubes uses the REST interface to communicate it is possible to use very simple programs in e.g. Jupyter Notebook to prompt responses from the minicube and perform analysis on extracted data.

We will provide full tutorials including extracted data that can be tried out and improved without the need for actually having a minicube device

We will also provide the tools for interacting with the Minicube devices on your network.
